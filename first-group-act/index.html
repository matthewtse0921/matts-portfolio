      DIRECTIONS: Let's discuss some of our favorite things!

      1. Create the h2 tag "Favorite Foods."
      2. Create an unordered list of at least three of your favorite foods.
      3. Make an h2 header for "Favorite Animals."
      4. Make an ordered list of at least three of your favorite animals.
      5. Make an h3 header for "Cute Animals."
      6. Are you a cat or a dog person? Why not both? Make a paragraph tag containing the text, "It's raining cats and dogs!"
      7. Make an image tag with the alt attribute set to "Dog Picture" and the src attribute set to "http://place-puppy.com/200x200"
      8. Make an image tag with the alt attribute set to "Cat Picture" and the src attribute set to "http://placekitten.com/200/200"
      9. Don't forget to give credit! Let's make a link tag (<a>) that credits placekitten. The href attribute should be set to the website address "http://placekitten.com" and the link text (between the opening and closing tags) should be "Place Kitten."
      10. Repeat step 9 for place-puppy.
      11. Wrap your two links from steps 9 and 10 in a paragraph (<p>) tag to place them on their own line.

      BONUS:
      - The numbers on the placeholder links represent the image size in pixels. Try changing the numbers to see different images of cats and dogs in various sizes.
      - Explore a little! There are tons of image placeholder sitesâ€”not just for cats and dogs, but for many different interests. Find one that you really like and put an example in.
